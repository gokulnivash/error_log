1. I have created a Lambda function and implemented functionality to retrieve error messages using a regular expression to filter the error details.
2. I have integrated the Lambda function with the API Gateway, where the request is passed from the API Gateway to the Lambda. The Lambda processes the request body and sends the output back to the user.
